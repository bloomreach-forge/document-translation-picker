      <p>
        The document translation picker project provides a plugin to the CMS interface. It enables editors to pick
        existing documents as a translation for a document.
      </p>
      <subsection name="Usage">
        <p>
          This plugin adds a menu item to the 'document' item in the toolbar. A CMS user can use it to open a dialog
          and select existing documents in translated folders. These documents will get the same, newly created,
          translationID as the current document.
        </p>
